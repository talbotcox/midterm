   										<h2>Richard Murry</h2>
   										<p>Triathlete Richard Murray has the amazing ability to stay under pressure and not let high-profile race situations intimidate him. Bursting onto the world elite triathlete scene back in 2012, he claimed a silver medal in the first ITU World Triathlon series event in Sydney and a bronze in San Diego. These two results secured him a spot at the London Olympic Games… The Olympics was by far the highlight of the young triathlete’s short professional career, but experts were not surprised. With two World Junior Duathlon titles under his belt and having won the All African Triathlon Championships twice, his talent is unquestionable. But in endurance racing sports, far more so than in any other, talent is not enough. Murray compliments the engine he was genetically blessed with, with a rigorous training regime and a willingness to work on his weaknesses, which, by his own admission, has always been the swim leg.</p>
